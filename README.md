# Fake-News-Prediction-MultinomalNB-LSTM
A Naive Bayes(Multinomial NB)-LSTM-based hybrid model for fake news classification, leveraging probability scores from Naive Bayes as input features for an LSTM network to enhance accuracy. This project applies NLP techniques for text preprocessing and deep learning for improved fake news detection.
